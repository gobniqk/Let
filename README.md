This python file has no real uses and is just here to test stuff.  
If you really wanna see something important stop looking at my profile, because like how did you even get here?
## What's in it?
  
The python file consists of 2 functions and a class.  
A timeit function which is a decorator to test a function running time.  
A sumDigits function that sums the digits of a number.  
And a class called Date with 3 attributes: day, month, year. And a method called compare.
